features:
- title: Elegant and Simple
  details: DexKit is built with a user-friendly API entirely using Kotlin DSL, supporting nested complex queries and providing good support for Java as well.
- title: High-Performance
  details: Implemented using C++ at its core, DexKit delivers superior performance. It utilizes multiple algorithms on top of multithreading, allowing it to complete complex searches in an extremely short time.
- title: Cross-platform
  details: It offers multi-platform support. After testing on Windows, Linux, or MacOS, the code can be directly migrated to the Android platform.

### Ultimate Experience, Say No to Tediousness

#### Example Code

> Assume this is obfuscated code from a host app. We need to dynamically adapt the hook for this method. 
> Due to obfuscation, method names and class names may change with each version.

```java
public class abc {

    public boolean cvc() {
        boolean b = false;
        // ...
        Log.d("VipCheckUtil", "userInfo: xxxx");
        // ...
        return b;
    }
}
```

DexKit can easily solve this problem!

#### Xposed hook code

> By creating an instance of `DexKitBridge`, we can perform specific searches on the app's dex file.

::: warning warning
Only one instance of `DexKitBridge` needs to be created. If you do not wish to use 
try-with-resources or Kotlin's .use for automatic closing of the `DexKitBridge` instance, 
you need to manage its lifecycle manually. Ensure to call `.close()` when it's no longer 
needed to prevent memory leaks.
